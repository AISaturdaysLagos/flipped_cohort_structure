# AI Saturdays Lagos Data Science and Machine Learning (ML) Flipped Cohort 1

## What is the ML Flipped Cohort about?
The ML Flipped Cohort is a structured, community-driven Machine Learning learning experience designed for beginners. The goal is to equip participants with foundational to intermediate ML knowledge using a flipped classroom model where learners independently consume pre-recorded content during the week, then attend a weekly community to discuss, explore and ask questions about what they’ve learned.

### Each week, participants will:
- Be assigned selected videos (from a curated playlist of lectures, labs).
- Receive supporting materials like Jupyter notebooks, slides, and an assessment.
- Join a live session/community call on weekends to engage with one of the organisers.

### At the end of the program, participants will:
- Participate in the capstone projects.
- Demonstrate real-world understanding through a project presentation or submission.

### Who is it for?
The ML Flipped Cohort is ideal for:
- Students and recent graduates looking to break into data science or machine learning.
- Working professionals or career switchers with some programming background, looking to transition into ML roles.
- Self-learners who’ve struggled with consistency and want accountability and mentorship.
- Basic knowledge of Python is expected, but beginner-friendly Python resources will be shared in Week 1 as a refresher.

### How long will it be?
The cohort will run for 10-12 weeks, structured as follows:
- 10 weeks of structured learning covering core ML topics.
- 2 weeks of project implementation and presentation.
