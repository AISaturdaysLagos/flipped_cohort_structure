# AI Saturdays Lagos — ML Flipped Cohort 1

The **ML Flipped Cohort** is a structured, community-driven Machine Learning learning experience designed for beginners. The goal is to equip participants with foundational to intermediate ML knowledge using a flipped classroom model where learners independently consume pre-recorded content during the week, then attend a weekly community to discuss, explore and ask questions about what they’ve learned.

---

## What is the ML Flipped Cohort About?

The program follows a **flipped classroom model** where:

- Participants watch curated **pre-recorded lectures** and complete labs during the week.
- Every Saturday, they attend a **community call** to engage with one of the organizers.

Each week, participants will:
- Be assigned selected videos (from a curated playlist of lectures and labs)
- Receive supporting materials like Jupyter notebooks, slides, and assessments
- Join a **live Zoom session** on weekends to engage with instructors and peers
- Interact daily on **Discord** for Q&A, collaboration, and accountability

By the end of the program, participants will:
- Participate in a **capstone project** - Present their solutions to  demonstrate real-world understanding

---

## Who is This For?

This program is ideal for:
- Students and recent graduates exploring data science or ML
- Career switchers with programming experience aiming to enter ML roles
- Self-learners seeking structure, mentorship, and a community

**Prerequisite**: Basic Python knowledge is expected  
> We’ll provide beginner-friendly Python resources during Week 1 for anyone needing a refresher.
